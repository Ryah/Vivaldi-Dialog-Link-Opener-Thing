Currently only uses Google, but you can easily change it by editing line 99.

# How to install: 
0) Download this repo

1) Enable css customization (not sure if required, but modding Vivaldi is a rabbit hole so you will eventually want to enable it)
https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/modding-vivaldi

2) Put `installJS.bat` and `open-link-in-dialogue-mode.js` into the folder you setup for css customization in step 1

3) Run `installJS.bat`

NOTE: If you installed Vivaldi somewhere other than the default install path (`%localappdata%\Vivaldi\Application\`), you need to edit line 8 in `installJS.bat` to point to the install path.

For mac and linux instructions, visit this link (it's also where I got `installJS.bat` from): https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10592/patching-vivaldi-with-batch-scripts
